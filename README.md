# Deep Learning Lab 2024 - Team Generative Models 
The foundation for this project is the BirdSet dataset provide by the **DBD-research-group**.

## open questions:
- can bird call audio samples be learned and synthesized by a generative model
- can synthetic samples be used to improve the training of classification models
- can synthetic samples be used to define better benchmarks for classification models

The Model uses preprocessed 5 seconds audios to generate 5 seconds sound. how ever till now it has not gained a good result!

consist a  generaative audio as result and a notebook file.

The results could be better by using call snippets. So this is not the version which we could evaluate as the best one for WaveNet!
"See call snippets :)"
